| **Project Summary** |
| :---: |
| This project documents the journey of a high school student who single-handedly designed, built, and coded an AI-powered smart glass prototype from scratch, using personal funds. The "Embedded AI Vision Glass" (EGG) is an award-winning assistive device created to enhance the independence of visually impaired individuals by interpreting their environment. It transforms the abstract concept of sight into tangible information through object recognition, text-to-speech, and live translation. |

This repository serves as a comprehensive technical archive for the EGG project, detailing its entire lifecycle. It is designed as both a portfolio showcase and a reference for those interested in embedded systems, IoT, and applied AI.

## üìÇ Project Structure

This project is organized into five main sections, each documenting a different aspect of the development process:

*   **[1_Hardware_Design](./1_Hardware_Design/):** Contains all schematics (Fritzing) and physical layout diagrams.
*   **[2_Firmware](./2_Firmware/):** Includes the C++/Arduino source code for both the ESP32 Controller and the ESP32-CAM Processor.
*   **[3_Cloud_Backend](./3_Cloud_Backend/):** Holds the Node.js source code for the AWS Lambda function and the EC2 WebSocket server.
*   **[4_Mobile_Application](./4_Mobile_Application/):** Contains the source code for the Android companion app.
*   **[5_Project_Documentation](./5_Project_Documentation/):** An extensive archive of all reports, presentations, and media files from the project's journey.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

The EGG project is a full-stack IoT solution built on a three-tier architecture.

</p>

*   **Hardware & Embedded:** A **Dual-MCU Architecture** (ESP32-WROOM-32 + ESP32-CAM) is used to distribute tasks efficiently. The main controller handles UI and Bluetooth, while a dedicated processor manages the camera, Wi-Fi, and AI-related tasks. The two communicate via UART, overcoming the performance issues of running Wi-Fi and Bluetooth simultaneously on a single MCU.
*   **Cloud Backend:** A serverless architecture on **AWS** performs all heavy AI processing. This includes **API Gateway** for requests, **Lambda** for logic, **S3** for storage, and AI services like **AWS Textract** (OCR) and **AWS Rekognition** (Object/Face/Currency Detection).
*   **Mobile App (Android):** A user-friendly interface to control the glasses and receive real-time results via Bluetooth and a cloud backend. It utilizes a Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine and the Google Translate API for multilingual support.

## üåü Key Features

*   **Text Analysis (OCR):** Reads text from documents and signs.
*   **Live Text Translation:** Translates and reads foreign text.
*   **Scene Description:** Identifies objects in the user's surroundings.
*   **Dual Control System:** Can be controlled via on-board capacitive touchpads or voice commands through the companion app.
*   **Connectivity Modes:** Includes a **Live Video Streaming** mode via WebSockets and an **FTP Server Mode** for wireless access to photos on the SD card.
*   **Assistive Features:** Integrated Bluetooth headset for audio feedback and a voice-activated high-intensity LED flashlight.

## üñºÔ∏è Project Showcase: From Idea to Award-Winning Prototype
