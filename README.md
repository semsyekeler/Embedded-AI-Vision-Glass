| **Project Summary** |
| :---: |
| This project documents the journey of a high school student who single-handedly designed, built, and coded an AI-powered smart glass prototype from scratch, using personal funds. The "Embedded AI Vision Glass" (EGG) is an award-winning assistive device created to enhance the independence of visually impaired individuals by interpreting their environment. It transforms the abstract concept of sight into tangible information through object recognition, text-to-speech, and live translation. |

This repository serves as a comprehensive technical archive for the EGG project, detailing its entire lifecycle. It is designed as a portfolio showcase and a reference for those interested in embedded systems, IoT, and applied AI.

## Project Outline

This project chronicles the creation of the EGG in 5 main chapters, each detailed in its respective document:

*   **[Chapter I: The Idea and The "Why"](./5_Project_Documentation/1_The_Idea_and_The_Why.md)**
    The motivation behind the project and the vision for creating a true cognitive sight experience.

*   **[Chapter II: Hardware Architecture & Assembly](./5_Project_Documentation/2_Hardware_Architecture.md)**
    A deep dive into the hardware decisions, including the **Dual-MCU Architecture**, power management system, and hands-on assembly process.

*   **[Chapter III: The Software Ecosystem](./5_Project_Documentation/3_Software_Ecosystem.md)**
    An explanation of the three-tiered software structure: **Firmware** (Embedded C++), **Cloud Backend** (AWS Serverless), and the **Mobile Application** (Android).

*   **[Chapter IV: Capabilities and Live Demos](./5_Project_Documentation/4_Capabilities_and_Demos.md)**
    A showcase of what the EGG can do, with details on **AI-Powered Vision** (OCR, Object Detection), user interface, and connectivity modes.

*   **[Chapter V: Competitions, Challenges, and Learnings](./5_Project_Documentation/5_Competitions_and_Learnings.md)**
    Reflections on the journey, including winning 3rd place at an international robotics competition, feedback from TEKNOFEST judges, and the lessons learned.
